To facilitate a more comprehensive review of the proposed project for ICC, NEDA requested submission of the following:
  
1. Annual actual expended budget given that NIA has already started implementation of the project since 2011 using the project's allocated funds under the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of the agency;
2. Proposed implementation arrangements considering that the Agricultural Support component is proposed to be undertaken by the Agricultural Training Institute (ATI) under the Department of Agriculture (DA), and the Social Component, which is proposed to be implemented by the concerned local government unit (LGU) project beneficiaries outside of the scope of the project;
3. Department of Budget and Management's (Department of Budget and Management) approval of the revised budget strategy for the project, reflecting the annual and total investment requirement considering that the project is proposed to be financed locally. It is important to establish at the outset if the proposed project can still be accomodated for funding given that NIA is proposing to implement several of its proposed projects through local funding, such as the Casecnan Multipurpose Irrigation and Power Project-Irrigation Component, Phase II (CMIPP-IP II), Umayam River Irrigation Project (UMIP), and Balog-Balog Multipurpose Project, Phase 2, and Agno River Irrigation System Extension Project (ARISEP), among others, that require about PhP27.08 billion of investment spread within the period 2012-2018;
4. Department of Finance-Corporate Affairs Group's (DOF-CAG) review/ endorsement of the project noting that the new project configuraion would have a different financial impact on NIA;
5. Financial and economic re-evaluations of the project taking into account the revised configuration, including updated project's Investment Coordination Committee-Project Evaluation (ICC-PE) forms (based on current prices), and the electronic copies (in traceable formula format) of all relevant spreadsheets to include all the assumptions used, computations of net farm income, revenues from irrigation service fees (ISF), amount of government subsidy, required ISF to sufficiently cover the O&M of the systems, among others ('please refer to the attached ICC-Checklist for a more comprehensive list of the ICC requisite documents'); and
