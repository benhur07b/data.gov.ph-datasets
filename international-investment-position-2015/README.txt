This dataset contains the International Investment Position (IIP) Statistics of the Philippines. The IIP is a companion framework to the BOP statistics.  While the BOP is a statistical statement that records the country’s transactions or flows with the rest of the world for a given period, the IIP summarizes the country’s stock of external financial assets and external financial liabilities outstanding as of a given period. The stock is the result of all the past transactions, changes in price movements, and others that are not due to transactions, to account for the value of the financial asset/liability as of date of reporting.
