This dataset contains the Producer's Price Index (PPI) for manufacturing, a composite figure of producer's price of representative commodities included in the market basket. It is used to measure monthly or yearly changes in producer's prices of key commodities in the manufacturing sector. It is also used to deflate production indicators such as Value of Production Index (VAPI) and Volume of Production Index (VOPI), and serves as the deflator in the estimation of manufacturing production in the system of national accounts.
