This dataset contains the series on monthly average bank lending rates.  Bank Average Lending Rate is the weighted average interest rate charged by reporting commercial banks on loans granted during a given period of time.  Monthly data is derived as the ratio of actual interest income of all commercial banks on their peso-denominated loans to the total outstanding level of these loans.
