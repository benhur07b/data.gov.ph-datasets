This dataset contains the interest rates on the special deposit account facility of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Special Deposit      Accounts (SDA) are fixed-term deposits by banks and trust entities of BSP-supervised financial institutions with the BSP. These deposits were introduced in November 1998 to expand the BSP's toolkit for liquidity management. In April 2007, the BSP expanded the access to the SDA facility to allow trust entities of financial institutions under BSP supervision to deposit in the facility.
