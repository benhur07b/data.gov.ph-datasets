This dataset is an information management system that identifies who and where the poor are in the country.  The output during the survey were based through the identification of poor areas based on the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) of the National Statistics Office (NSO) and Small Area Estimates (SAEs) of the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB). The NHTS-PR looked into the poverty incidence of provinces/municipalities/cities for the purpose of prioritizing the areas to assess since the project can not cover all areas at once. The poverty incidence of the provinces/municipalities/cities also determined the method of assessment to implement. Ten (10) indicators are used in identifying pockets of poverty.
Household assessment is conducted using the household assessment form (HAF), a two-page questionnaire with 34 variables.
All the information found in the household assessment forms are then encoded to a web application and subjected to Proxy Means Test (PMT). It is a statistical model that estimates the income of households using the proxy variables indicated in the HAF. These include family composition, education of household members, housing conditions, and access to basic services.
