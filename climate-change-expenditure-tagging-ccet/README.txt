The Climate Change Expenditure Tagging (CCET) is a process for identifying, reporting, and tracking Programs, Activities, and Projects (PAPs) that are responsive to climate change adaptation and/or climate change mitigation. This is being done by the National Government Agencies (NGAs) by submitting a climate change (CC) expenditure form (or the BP Form 201F) to the Department of Budget and Management during the budget preparation, and once the National Expenditure Program (NEP) and the General Appropriations Act (GAA) were approved.
