  "notes": "This dataset contains barangay-level information on the 14 core indicators of CBMS in the province of Camarines Norte. These 14 indicators are: (1) malnourished children 0 to 5 years old; (2) death of children 0 to 4 years old; (3) death of women due to pregnancy-related causes; (4) households without access to safe water; (5) households without access to sanitary toilet facilities; (6) households living in makeshift housing; (7) households who are informal settlers; (8) children aged 6 to 12 not attending elementary school; (9) children aged 13 to 16 not attending secondary school; (10) children aged 6 to 16 not attending school; (11) population who are unemployed; (12) households with income below poverty threshold; (13) households with income below food threshold; and (14) households who experienced food shortage. The data shows magnitude and proportion per barangay in each indicator; magnitude refers to the actual count of individuals/households in a given sample of the population while proportion refers to the percentage of the magnitude relative to the total count in a given sample of the population.",
